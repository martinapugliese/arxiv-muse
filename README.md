## What is this

Askademic is an AI agent that helps you with finding information in research papers. It queries the arXiv API and can:
* summarise the latest papers in a category/subcategory for you
* answer questions by retrieving relevant papers and searching within them to produce an answer
It also allows you to have a conversation, that is, to ask for follow-up questions.

As for everything that uses LLM, check your outputs - it can male mistakes. The tool is designed to provide short answers and suggestions, leaving to the user the effort to dive deeper into the matter.

And, it has an eye for things non-scientific... see below.

It works as a CLI tool.

Askademic uses Google Gemini 2.0 as its underlying LLM. We aim to expand it to allow for multiple LLMs in the (near) future, especially open ones, but this early choice has been motivated by some factors:
* it has a free tier - we wrote the agent in such a way to privilege cost-effectiveness over speed, which means for short conversations you should be within the quotas of the free tier
* it has a very large context window, very useful for questions where extensive searches over many papers are needed
* it works pretty well for this use cases

Askademic is built on [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) as its agents framework.

## Requirements

Works with Python 3.11 and above.

## Installation & setup

This release is a beta and askademic has not been published on PyPI _yet_.

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into it and pip install it as `pip install .`

  Alternatively, you can `pip install` from the GitHub link.
  Or, use `uv` with `uv tool install --python python3.11 .` â€” this lets you choose the exact Python version for your environment, which is useful for testing or compatibility.

3. Then, you need a Gemini API key. Head to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to generate it and run

```
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Run it

You just run it with command `askademic` from the terminal.

## Roadmap and issues

This is a beta. If you see this, please try it and give us feedback. If you find quirks or something that is not great, you are more than welcome to open an issue in this repo, please describe the issue clearly, ideally with screenshots.

We have several ideas to develop this further, adding new capabilities and features, so stay tuned!
