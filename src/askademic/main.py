    You can ask me to:
    - summarize the latest literature (published in the latest available day) in an arXiv category or subcategory,
    - retrieve answers for specific research questions/topics

    Ask me a question with either of these requests.
    For the summary, I will find the best matching arXiv category to your request.
    For the specific topic, I will look for relevant papers and find the answer for you.

    I will write to a logs file filenamed with today's date.
