      "ABSTRACT\n",
      "In recent years deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems have attained superhuman\n",
      "performance in a number of challenging task domains. However, a major limitation\n",
      "of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical\n",
      "present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new\n",
      "tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which\n",
      "we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that\n",
      "recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We\n",
      "extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained\n",
      "using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite\n",
      "separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the\n",
      "original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is conﬁgured\n",
      "to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of\n",
      "seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep\n",
      "meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and\n",
      "also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "Recent advances have allowed long-standing methods for reinforcement learning (RL) to be newly\n",
      "extended to such complex and large-scale task environments as Atari (Mnih et al., 2015) and Go\n",
      "(Silver et al., 2016). The key enabling breakthrough has been the development of techniques allowing\n",
      "the stable integration of RL with non-linear function approximation through deep learning (LeCun\n",
      "et al., 2015; Mnih et al., 2015). The resulting deep RL methods are attaining human- and often\n",
      "superhuman-level performance in an expanding list of domains (Jaderberg et al., 2016; Mnih et al.,\n",
      "2015; Silver et al., 2016). However, there are at least two aspects of human performance that they\n",
      "starkly lack. First, deep RL typically requires a massive volume of training data, whereas human\n",
      "learners can attain reasonable performance on any of a wide range of tasks with comparatively little\n",
      "experience. Second, deep RL systems typically specialize on one restricted task domain, whereas\n",
      "human learners can ﬂexibly adapt to changing task conditions. Recent critiques (e.g., Lake et al.,\n",
      "2016) have invoked these differences as posing a direct challenge to current deep RL research.\n",
      "In the present work, we outline a framework for meeting these challenges, which we refer to as\n",
      "deep meta-reinforcement learning, a label that is intended to both link it with and distinguish it\n",
      "from previous work employing the term “meta-reinforcement learning” (e.g. Schmidhuber et al.,\n",
      "1996; Schweighofer and Doya, 2003, discussed later). The key concept is to use standard deep RL\n",
      "techniques to train a recurrent neural network in such a way that the recurrent network comes to\n",
      "implement its own, free-standing RL procedure. As we shall illustrate, under the right circumstances,\n",

      "2.1\n",
      "BACKGROUND: META-LEARNING IN RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS\n",
      "Flexible, data-efﬁcient learning naturally requires the operation of prior biases. In general terms,\n",
      "such biases can derive from two sources; they can either be engineered into the learning system (as,\n",
      "for example, in convolutional networks), or they can themselves be acquired through learning. The\n",
      "second case has been explored in the machine learning literature under the rubric of meta-learning\n",
      "(Schmidhuber et al., 1996; Thrun and Pratt, 1998).\n",
      "In one standard setup, the learning agent is confronted with a series of tasks that differ from one\n",
      "another but also share some underlying set of regularities. Meta-learning is then deﬁned as an\n",
      "effect whereby the agent improves its performance in each new task more rapidly, on average, than\n",
      "in past tasks (Thrun and Pratt, 1998). At an architectural level, meta-learning has generally been\n",
      "conceptualized as involving two learning systems: one lower-level system that learns relatively\n",
      "quickly, and which is primarily responsible for adapting to each new task; and a slower higher-level\n",
      "system that works across tasks to tune and improve the lower-level system.\n",
      "A variety of methods have been pursued to implement this basic meta-learning setup, both within\n",
      "the deep learning community and beyond (Thrun and Pratt, 1998). Of particular relevance here is\n",
      "an approach introduced by Hochreiter and colleagues (Hochreiter et al., 2001), in which a recurrent\n",
      "neural network is trained on a series of interrelated tasks using standard backpropagation. A critical\n",
      "aspect of their setup is that the network receives, on each step within a task, an auxiliary input\n",
      "indicating the target output for the preceding step. For example, in a regression task, on each step\n",
      "the network receives as input an x value for which it is desired to output the corresponding y, but the\n",
      "network also receives an input disclosing the target y value for the preceding step (see Hochreiter\n",
      "et al., 2001; Santoro et al., 2016). In this scenario, a different function is used to generate the data\n",
      "in each training episode, but if the functions are all drawn from a single parametric family, then the\n",
      "system gradually tunes into this consistent structure, converging on accurate outputs more and more\n",
      "rapidly across episodes.\n",
      "One interesting aspect of Hochreiter’s method is that the process that underlies learning within each\n",
      "new task inheres entirely in the dynamics of the recurrent network, rather than in the backpropagation\n",
      "procedure used to tune that network’s weights. Indeed, after an initial training period, the network\n",
      "can improve its performance on new tasks even if the weights are held constant (see also Cotter\n",
      "and Conwell, 1990; Prokhorov et al., 2002; Younger et al., 1999). A second important aspect of the\n",
      "approach is that the learning procedure implemented in the recurrent network is ﬁt to the structure\n",
      "that spans the family of tasks on which the network is trained, embedding biases that allow it to learn\n",
      "efﬁciently when dealing with tasks from that family.\n",

      "DEEP META-RL: DEFINITION AND KEY FEATURES\n",
      "Importantly, Hochreiter’s original work (Hochreiter et al., 2001), as well as its subsequent extensions\n",
      "(Cotter and Conwell, 1990; Prokhorov et al., 2002; Santoro et al., 2016; Younger et al., 1999) only\n",
      "addressed supervised learning (i.e. the auxiliary input provided on each step explicitly indicated the\n",
      "target output on the previous step, and the network was trained using explicit targets). In the present\n",
      "work we consider the implications of applying the same approach in the context of reinforcement\n",
      "learning. Here, the tasks that make up the training series are interrelated RL problems, for example,\n",
      "a series of bandit problems varying only in their parameterization. Rather than presenting target\n",
      "outputs as auxiliary inputs, the agent receives inputs indicating the action output on the previous step\n",
      "and, critically, the quantity of reward resulting from that action. The same reward information is fed\n",
      "in parallel to a deep RL procedure, which tunes the weights of the recurrent network.\n",
      "It is this setup, as well as its result, that we refer to as deep meta-RL (although from here on, for\n",
      "brevity, we will often simply call it meta-RL, with apologies to authors who have used that term\n",
      "2\n",
      "\fpreviously). As in the supervised case, when the approach is successful, the dynamics of the recurrent\n",
      "network come to implement a learning algorithm entirely separate from the one used to train the\n",
      "network weights. Once again, after sufﬁcient training, learning can occur within each task even if the\n",
      "weights are held constant. However, here the procedure the recurrent network implements is itself a\n",
      "full-ﬂedged reinforcement learning algorithm, which negotiates the exploration-exploitation tradeoff\n",
      "and improves the agent’s policy based on reward outcomes. A key point, which we will emphasize in\n",
      "what follows, is that this learned RL procedure can differ starkly from the algorithm used to train the\n",
      "network’s weights. In particular, its policy update procedure (including features such as the effective\n",
      "learning rate of that procedure), can differ dramatically from those involved in tuning the network\n",
      "weights, and the learned RL procedure can implement its own approach to exploration. Critically, as\n",

      "After training, the agent’s policy is ﬁxed (i.e. the weights are frozen, but the activations are changing\n",

      "EXPERIMENTS\n",
      "In order to evaluate the approach to learning that we have just described, we conducted a series of\n",
      "six proof-of-concept experiments, which we present here along with a seventh experiment originally\n",
      "reported in a related paper (Mirowski et al., 2016). One particular point of interest in these experiments\n",
      "was to see whether meta-RL could be used to learn an adaptive balance between exploration and\n",
      "exploitation, as demanded of any fully-ﬂedged RL procedure. A second and still more important\n",

      "distributions – performing comparably to Gittins (Figure 2c-f), and superiorly compared to agents\n",

      "trained on independent rewards (Di) has not learned to exploit the reward correlations that are useful\n",

      "This makes sense, as training on correlated arms may produce a policy that relies on speciﬁc reward\n",
      "structure, thereby impacting performance in problems where no such structure exists. iii) Whilst\n",

      "this result are warranted. As noted in our presentation of the simulation results, the pattern of choice\n",
      "behavior displayed by the network has been considered in the cognitive and neuroscience literatures\n",
      "as reﬂecting model-based control or tree search. However, as has been remarked in very recent work,\n",
      "the same pattern can arise from a model-free system with an appropriate state representation (Akam\n",
      "et al., 2015). Indeed, we suspect this may be how our network in fact operates. However, other\n",
      "ﬁndings suggest that a more explicitly model-based control mechanism can emerge when a similar\n",
      "system is trained on a more diverse set of tasks. In particular, Ilin et al. (2007) showed that recurrent\n",
      "networks trained on random mazes can approximate dynamic programming procedures (see also\n",
      "Silver et al., 2017; Tamar et al., 2016). At the same time, as we have stressed, we consider it an\n",
      "important aspect of deep meta-RL that it yields a learned RL algorithm that capitalizes on invariances\n",
      "in task structure. As a result, when faced with widely varying but still structured environments, deep\n",
      "meta-RL seems likely to generate RL procedures that occupy a grey area between model-free and\n",

      "The two-step decision problem studied in Section 3.2.1 was derived from neuroscience, and we\n",
      "believe deep meta-RL may have important implications in that arena (Wang et al., 2017). The notion\n",
      "of meta-RL has been discussed previously in neuroscience but only in a narrow sense, according\n",
      "to which meta-learning adjusts scalar hyperparameters such as the learning rate or softmax inverse\n",
